## Multivariable-control-and-coordination-systems

This is the case studies of [Multivariable control and coordination systems (EE-477)](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/multivariable-control-and-coordination-systems-EE-477?cb_cycle=bama_cyclemaster&cb_section=mt_ro) supervised by [Prof. Denis Gillet](https://people.epfl.ch/denis.gillet) at EPFL. The general objective of the case studies is to design a closed-loop controller with observer to make the vehicle follow the reference trajectories. The case studies includes modeling the system, linearization, discretization and designing a controller and an observer.
