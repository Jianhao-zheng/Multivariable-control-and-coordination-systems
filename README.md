## Multivariable-control-and-coordination-systems

This is the case studies of Multivariable control and coordination systems (EE-477) at EPFL. The general objective of the case studies is to design a closed-loop controller with observer to make the vehicle follow the reference trajectories. The case studies includes modeling the system, linearization, discretization and designing a controller and an observer.
